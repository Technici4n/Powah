      "text": "An Ender Cell provides energy (FE) storage and transfer without cables and across dimensions using the $(l:store_and_transfer/ender_network)Ender Network$(l). There are 7 tiers of Ender Cells and higher tiers give access to more channels. $(p) The Ender Network has 8 channels to store and transfer energy. Channels can't store or transfer energy until you add capacity to them with an $(l:store_and_transfer/energy_cell)Energy Cell$(/l) or a $(l:store_and_transfer/battery)Battery$(/l). You add capacity to a channel by right-clicking an Ender Cell and shift-clicking an Energy Cell or a Battery in your inventory. The capacity of the Energy Cell or a Battery will be permanently added to the selected channel, any energy in the item will be added to the channel, and the item will be consumed."
