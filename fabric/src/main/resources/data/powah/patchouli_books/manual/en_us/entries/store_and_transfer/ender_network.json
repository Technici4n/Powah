      "text": "The Ender Network is made up of Ender Cells without optional Ender Gates. It has 12 channels to store and transfer energy. Channels can't store or transfer energy until you add capacity to them with an $(l:store_and_transfer/energy_cell)Energy Cell$(/l) or a $(l:store_and_transfer/battery)Battery$(/l). You add capacity to a channel by right-clicking an Ender Cell and shift-clicking an Energy Cell or Battery in your inventory. The capacity of the Energy Cell or a Battery will be permanently added to the selected channel, any energy in the item will be added to the channel, and the item will be consumed."
