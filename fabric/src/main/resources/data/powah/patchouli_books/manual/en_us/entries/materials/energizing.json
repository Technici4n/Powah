      "text": "An Energizing Orb is used to Energize items, turning them into something new. Energizing requires at least one Energizing Rod within a %s range. Energizing speed depends on the amount of Energizing Rods and their tier. An Energizing Orb does not require energy but Energizing Rods must be placed on Energy Cables or another Powah block with energy. An Energizing Orb and Energizing Rods will automatically link to each other when they are in range. You can use the <powah:wrench> in Link mode to view the link and manually link."
